# Vehicle Tracking System

## Overview

The **Vehicle Tracking System** is a scalable application designed to track vehicle locations in real-time, manage geofencing, and provide insights into fleet operations. This system utilizes **Java** and **Spring Boot** for backend development, **AWS SQS** for asynchronous messaging, **AWS DynamoDB** for data storage, and **Docker** for containerization and deployment.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle location tracking
- Geofencing and compliance management
- Scalable and reliable data handling
- Automated report generation
- Asynchronous messaging and data transfer

## Architecture

- **Java** and **Spring Boot**: Backend services for handling business logic and API endpoints.
- **AWS SQS**: Asynchronous messaging service for reliable data transfer between components.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing vehicle data, tracking information, and geofencing details.
- **AWS S3**: Object storage for storing images, reports, and other output files.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for consistent deployment across different environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- AWS CLI
- Java 11 or higher
- Spring Boot CLI (optional)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vehicle-tracking-system.git cd vehicle-tracking-system

2. **Build Docker Images**

docker build -t vehicle-tracking-system .

3. **Run Docker Containers**

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name vehicle-tracking-system vehicle-tracking-system

4. **Configure AWS Services**

- Set up an AWS SQS queue.
- Configure DynamoDB tables for vehicle tracking and geofencing data.
- Create an S3 bucket for storing reports and images.

5. **Deploy to AWS EC2**

- Launch an EC2 instance and install Docker.
- Pull and run the Docker container on the EC2 instance.

  ``` 
  docker pull vehicle-tracking-system 
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name vehicle-tracking-system vehicle-tracking-system 
  ```

- Ensure the EC2 instance has access to the required AWS services.

## Usage

1. **API Endpoints**

- `/api/vehicles` - Get real-time vehicle data.
- `/api/geofences` - Manage geofences and compliance.
- `/api/reports` - Generate and download reports.

2. **Monitoring and Management**

- Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application metrics.
- Configure alerts and auto-scaling based on performance metrics.

## CI/CD

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured with **AWS CodePipeline** for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Automated Tests**: Ensure code quality and application stability.
